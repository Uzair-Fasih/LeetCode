# Strategy 
The first strategy that I could come up with on my own is the two pass hashmap solution which is also documented in the solutions tab on LeetCode.
Since this is my strategy I will implement it even though better strategy exists; The One Pass Hashmap Solution.

I chose C as my language of choice.
C doesn't have a built in hashmap for me to use.
So I decided to implement in myself.
